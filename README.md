# javascript-projects

My solutions to some simple problems, implemented with Javascript.

## aoe2-lumberjacks

Lumberjack simulator for Age of Empires II.

## js-mandala

Is this a mandala? I don't know. But it has circles that spin around.

## css-mandala

Like `js-mandala` but it uses CSS only. Yes, there's no Javascript, but it felt right to include it here.

## fallout-76

A chart about perks in Fallout 76. This was accurate when the game was released in 2018, but I assume it's changed since then.

## monte-hall

Simulates the Monte Hall problem using JavaScript. I implemented this using [Clojure](https://github.com/cberes/monte-hall-clj) as well.
